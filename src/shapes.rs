//! ### Shapes
//!
//! Some functions to create various shapes of mazes.

/// Creates a directional line of length `n`, starting at `0`.
///
/// For example, `dir_line(4)`:
///
/// ```text
/// 0 → 1 → 2 → 3
/// ```

    }
    r
}

/// Creates a rectangle where every cell is connected to its
/// right and down neighbors.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```text
/// 0 → 1 → 2
/// ↓   ↓   ↓
/// 3 → 4 → 5
/// ↓   ↓   ↓
/// 6 → 7 → 8
/// ```
